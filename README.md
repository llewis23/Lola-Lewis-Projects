Hello! Thanks for stopping by my GitHub page. I’m Lola Lewis, a senior at Santa Clara University studying Finance and Business Analytics, graduating in June 2025.

I became interested in the world of finance when I began investing in stocks during high school. This sparked my cuiosity about how businesses operate, which motivated me to investigate the strategic decisions that drove their success. That experience sparked my curiosity about finance as I started college. I was drawn to business analytics after learning about it from a mentor in high school. What affirmed my decision to study business analytics was an intership I did with a start-up called GetVirtual. There, I helped collect and synthesize data to formulate insights for businesses impacted by COVID-19. I saw firsthand how transforming data could drive real business improvements. With technology constantly advancing, I felt those skills would be crucial going forward. 

In college, I joined the Santa Clara Investment Fund, a student-led organization entrusted with $100,000 AUM by the university endowment to allocate capital to equities. I currently work in the Technology (TMT) sector, where I’ve had the opportunity to create investment theses, build pitch decks, and improve my financial modeling skills for various technology companies. Being part of this prestigious group has been an incredible hands-on experience that’s allowed me to explore industry analysis and strategic capital allocation.

I created this GitHub to showcase projects that reflect my journey and experiences in finance and analytics. Feel free to explore my work, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you’d like to connect!
