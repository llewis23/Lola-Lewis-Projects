Hello! Thank you for stopping by my GitHub page. My name is Lola Lewis, and I’m a senior at Santa Clara University, studying Finance and Business Analytics, with an expected graduation in March 2025. I’ve created this page to showcase projects that reflect my academic and practical experiences, particularly in financial modeling and industry/company evaluation.

These projects include my work with the Santa Clara Investment Fund, where I contributed to in-depth financial analyses and industry research, as well as class projects that further developed my technical and analytical skills. Through these experiences, I’ve gained proficiency in modeling, data analysis, and strategic evaluation—skills.

I always like to meet new people. Please feel free to reach out and chat.
