Hello! Thanks for stopping by my GitHub page. I’m Lola Lewis, a senior at Santa Clara University studying Finance and Business Analytics, graduating in March 2025.

My passion for investing began in high school when I wanted to put my money to work, which led me to start investing in stocks. This experience sparked my interest in understanding how companies operate, and as I entered college, I became increasingly fascinated by the world of finance. I’ve especially enjoyed my classes like Financial Management, Investments, and Business Valuation, which deepened my interest and skills in the field.

In college, I joined the Santa Clara Investment Fund, a student-led organization entrusted with $100,000 AUM by the university endowment to allocate capital to equities. The fund is divided into four sectors: Technology (TMT), Healthcare, Consumer, and Climate. I currently work in the Technology sector, where I’ve had the opportunity to create investment theses, build pitch decks, and improve my valuation skills. Being part of this prestigious group has been an incredible hands-on experience that’s allowed me to explore industry analysis and strategic capital allocation.

I created this GitHub to showcase projects that reflect my journey and experiences in finance and analytics. Feel free to explore my work, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you’d like to connect!
